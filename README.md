# Wordle-Cpp
This C++ code simulates the Wordle game, designed as part of a university assignment. It allows the player to guess a five-letter word within a set number of attempts, providing feedback on each guess indicating correct letters and positions. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or exhausts their attempts.
